When to use Heap Sort:
Heap Sort is useful when you need a sorting algorithm that has a guaranteed worst-case time complexity of O(n log n). It is particularly efficient for large datasets and is often used in scenarios where other comparison-based sorting algorithms like Quick Sort and Merge Sort might have performance issues. Heap Sort is commonly used in various programming libraries and systems to ensure a predictable worst-case time complexity for sorting tasks.

Best Practices for Heap Sort:

Efficient Data Structures: Heap Sort relies on the heap data structure, which can be implemented as an array. Ensure that you have an efficient implementation of the heap data structure to optimize Heap Sort performance.
Avoid Unnecessary Copies: Heap Sort involves swapping elements during heapify operations. To optimize performance, try to minimize unnecessary copying of data during the swapping process.
Use the Right Heap Type: Heap Sort can be implemented using a max-heap (sorting in ascending order) or a min-heap (sorting in descending order). Choose the appropriate heap type based on your sorting requirements.
Runtime and Space Complexity:

Time Complexity: The worst-case and average-case time complexity of Heap Sort is O(n log n). This is because building the heap takes O(n) time, and the heapify operation takes O(log n) time, and it is performed n times (for each element).
Space Complexity: The space complexity of Heap Sort is O(1) since the sorting is performed in-place, and it does not require any additional memory allocation proportional to the input size. However, Heap Sort has a space overhead of O(n) if the input array needs to be duplicated to create the heap.
Overall, Heap Sort is a viable choice when you need a stable and predictable sorting algorithm with a worst-case time complexity of O(n log n) and when in-place sorting is preferred. However, for smaller arrays or when the space overhead is a concern, other algorithms like Insertion Sort or Selection Sort might be more suitable choices.
